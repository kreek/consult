# Code Review

## Iron Law

`FINDINGS FIRST. BLOCK ON CORRECTNESS, SAFETY, DATA LOSS, AND UNPROVEN CLAIMS.`

## When to Use

- Independent review of your diff in the `workflow` completion loop, after
  `proof` and before claiming done. Default for any non-trivial
  agent-generated change; use a fresh-context subagent, review agent, or
  separate session when the host provides one.
- Diff review: local, branch, or a GitHub PR through the host's GitHub surface.
- Review-comment follow-up on the user's own PRs.

## When NOT to Use

- Commit grouping or history repair only; use `git-workflow`.
- A narrow domain-only review where `security`, `database`, `api`, or
  `ui-design` is sufficient.

## Rules

1. Review owns defect discovery; `proof` owns checks. Find behavioral bugs,
   regressions, unsafe edge cases, missing evidence, and merge blockers.
2. Findings come first, in severity order, each with a file/line or thread
   anchor, the issue, its impact, a fix direction, and the evidence or missing
   proof. Summaries come after. Use a question only when ambiguity blocks the
   finding.

   | Severity | When to use |
   |---|---|
   | Critical | Exploitable security, data loss, broken auth, destructive migration, outage risk |
   | High | Incorrect behavior, broken contract, missing authorization, race, serious regression |
   | Medium | Maintainability, error handling, observability, compatibility, or test gaps likely to cause defects |
   | Low | Non-blocking clarity, skip unless asked |

3. Every review includes a security pass and a proof-evidence pass. A claim
   the review cannot verify is reported as unproven. Red or absent CI makes
   the review unproven, not blocked from inspection. Missing intent on a
   non-trivial PR is a finding.
4. Repository constraints beat generic advice. Check declared runtime,
   framework, dependency, CI, and support policy before applying a language
   reference.
5. Maintainability findings need a concrete risk: hidden state, coupled
   effects, stale flags, duplicated rules with divergent meaning, dead
   compatibility, unreachable paths. Style is not blocking unless it hides
   ambiguity or unsafe control flow.
6. Agent-written code gets an AI-generated risk pass: speculative abstraction,
   unnecessary shims, dead defensive code, test theater, fabricated APIs,
   scope creep, refactor drift, and code too large or vague for the human to
   keep a mental model of. Hand-rolled versions of solved problems (HTTP
   clients, ORMs, parsers, retry loops, validators, crypto) are findings.
7. A diff the human cannot review in one sitting gets a declared partial
   scope, and split/scope becomes a finding. Bundled reformatting or unrelated
   edits are split before deep review. Sample generated, vendored, and
   lockfile churn only enough to detect obvious risk.
8. GitHub reads run through the host's permission surface; `git-workflow`
   owns which surface. Modify a PR only when it belongs to the user or the
   user asks, and get explicit user permission for every write that publishes
   text: comments, reviews, thread resolution, pushes. When
   addressing feedback, fix the smallest coherent set of actionable requests
   and surface conflicting comments before editing.

### Independent Review

Code review runs in a fresh context: a subagent, review agent, fresh session,
or host review command. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, and Pi all have a
mechanism. Same-context review is not code review, only a labelled fallback
when the host truly lacks one. The reviewer gets exactly these inputs:

- The diff.
- The stated intent and acceptance criteria.
- The repo's declared constraints: runtime, framework, support policy, test
  command.

Withhold the implementation rationale. Why a line is there is what biases a
reviewer into accepting it; one who works the intent out from the diff finds
what the author's second pass cannot. Answer the reviewer's questions, but do
not pre-empt them with justification.

When no independent reviewer is available, label the review same-context and
treat its clean result as weaker evidence.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the target and pre-flight: intent, impact, CI status, changed
   surface, and the scope you can honestly cover.
2. Load only what the diff needs: the language guide for each language present
   and the domain skill for each touched risk. Load `release` only for
   concrete release artifacts or explicit release-readiness review.
3. Sweep by risk: security, behavior, evidence, dead surface, reuse,
   build-vs-adopt, AI-generated risk.
4. Write findings first. If none, name residual risk and unreviewed scope.

## Tripwires

| Trigger | Do this instead | False alarm |
|---|---|---|
| "Tests pass, so the diff is fine" | Passing tests prove only what they assert; still review safety, data, and dead-surface risk. | None. |
| "The author is careful, skim this one" | Trusting the author changes how you write findings, not how thoroughly you review. | None. |
| "The tests look thorough" | Test theater is a finding; load `proof` for the taxonomy. | Tests assert caller-observable behavior at real boundaries. |
| "The abstraction might be useful later" | Speculative abstraction waits for a real caller or requirement. | The requirement exists and is named. |
| "Defensive code never hurts" | Dead defensive code becomes a boundary assertion or is removed. | The guarded state is reachable and tested. |
| "It's labeled a refactor" | A refactor with observable behavior change is a feature change; review it as one. | Behavior preservation has before/after evidence. |
| "The shim is harmless, keep it" | Compatibility shims need owner, caller, removal condition, and proof. | All four are recorded. |
| "It's generated code, wave it through" | Oversized durable generated code is comprehension debt; make split/scope a finding. | Regenerable artifacts such as lockfiles, sampled for obvious risk. |

## Handoffs

- `specify`: plan-to-code divergence from an agreed design artifact.
- `security`: auth, trust boundaries, secrets, crypto, dependencies, injection.
- `database`: migrations, locking, transactions, schema, indexes.
- `release`: version, changelog, package, publish, or rollout readiness.
- `proof`: missing behavior coverage, test quality, mocks, flakes.
- `git-workflow`: branch mechanics and packaging accepted fixes.

## References

- Language reviewer guides, load one per language in the diff:
  `references/rust.md`, `references/fsharp.md`, `references/csharp.md`,
  `references/python.md`, `references/typescript.md`, `references/ruby.md`,
  `references/java.md`, `references/kotlin.md`, `references/bash.md`,
  `references/sql.md`.
